# GourmetGo

## Business Problem

GourmetGo is a web application designed to analyze and visualize restaurant data.

With more than 6,000 registered restaurants, users can find their favorite dining spots based on location by country, city, rating, and average price.

As a Data Scientist, I created solutions that aggregate information from restaurants worldwide in one place, making it easier for users to view and choose the ideal restaurant.

Hereâ€™s what you can explore:

### Main View
- Overview of the number of registered restaurants, countries, cities, ratings, and cuisines
- Cluster map based on average rating showing restaurant locations and information. Zoom in to see details. The greener the better!

### Countries
- Registered restaurants by country
- Registered cities by country
- Average ratings by country
- Average cost for two by country

### Cities
- Top 10 cities with the most restaurants
- Top 5 cities with the best and worst-rated restaurants
- Top 10 cities with the most diverse cuisine types

### Cuisines
- Top restaurants by cuisine
- Top 10 restaurants by average ratings
- Top 10 best and worst cuisines by average ratings

## Assumptions for the Analysis

- The business model assumed is a marketplace, integrating GourmetGo, restaurants, and users.
- The four main business views are: Main View, Countries View, Cities View, and Cuisines View.

## Solution Strategy

The strategic dashboard was developed using metrics that reflect the four main views of the company's business model, providing a unified and fluid experience for users.

## Top 5 Data Insights

1. The USA and India have the largest number of registered restaurants, comprising almost 65% of the total.
2. There are, on average, 55 registered restaurants per city globally.
3. Indonesia has the highest average restaurant rating, while Brazil has the lowest.
4. The most expensive restaurant is in Australia.
5. London is the city with the most highly-rated restaurants, while Gangtok, India, has the lowest-rated ones.

## Project's Final Product

The final product is an online dashboard, hosted on the cloud, accessible from any internet-connected device.

## Conclusion

The goal of this project is to create a set of charts and tables displaying these metrics in the best possible way for customers.

From the company's point of view, we can gain numerous insights to provide better services, such as identifying poorly performing restaurants and helping them improve based on consumer reviews, and working on marketing campaigns to register restaurants in cities where there is high demand but low supply.
